# EVER-ImageJ-Plugin

This is an ImageJ plugin to correct for the heterogeneous background, referred to as extreme value-based emitter recovery (EVER). This method can be used independently as a pre-processing step prior to single molecule localization to correct for heterogeneous background in the raw dataset from localization-based super-resolution microscopy. Refer to “EVER_readme.docx” for details.

The lookup table and testing data can be found [here] ("https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rc4U636sH4VSDQmT_wKczEO_06rZ8uPl?usp=sharing").
